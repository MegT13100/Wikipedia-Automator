# Final Project Proposal
## Leading Question
The Wiki Game, or the Wikipedia Race, is a popular game in which two players start on a randomly selected wikipedia page and must navigate through the hyperlinks within the page to a preselected target article. The fastest player wins. *Our project aims to automate the game and return the shortest hyperlink path between any two articles within Wikipedia. In addition, the user will be able to determine how "important" each article is in the graph to make the chosen articles easier or harder to link.*

Our project will use a BFS traversal to traverse the graph and find the nodes of interest (article names which the user inputs). BFS will also be used to find the shortest path between these two nodes and will return this path to the user. Page-Rank will be used to conceptually weigh the nodes (articles) in the graph and allow a user to input an article name and recieve it's importance in relation to the rest of the articles. The force-directed graph drawing will create a visualization of the entire dataset which the user can explore.

## Data Acquisition
- We are using the publicly available data from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection of wikipedia hyperlinks
    - Link: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-topcats.html
- We will acquire the data directly from the Stanford Network Analysis Project website, under the wiki-topcats dataset.
- We will process the data using the Stanford Network Analysis Platform, a network analysis and graph mining library. Since the graph is preprocessed from Wikipedia, we do not anticipate many issues. However, if needed, we will use SNAP to classify and connect nodes.
- In the event of an invalid input, or one which does not exist in the dataset (since the dataset only includes wikipedia articles which are linked > 100 times) the program will return that the input is not valid or does not have enough connections to compute a path.
- Since the dataset is limited to only Wikipedia pages with 100+ hyperlinks referencing them, the diameter of the graph is 9. We expect that this limitation will allow us to overcome any runtime or storage issues that may have otherwise interfered with the project.
## Graph Algorithms
- The graph traversal algorithm we will use:
    - BFS
        - Input:the name of the originating Wikipedia article, the name of the "goal" Wikipedia article
        - Output: shortest hyperlink paths between the two nodes
        - Expected Big O:O(n)
    - Page-Rank
        - Input:the name of a single Wikipedia article
        - Output: the "importance" or connectivity of the article within the graph of Wikipedia articles
        - Expected Big O: O(n + m)
    - Force-directed graph drawing
        - Input: All vertices and edges in the graph dataset
        - Output: an interactive, colored force-directed graph containing all of the nodes and edges in our dataset.
        - Expected Big O: O(n^3)
