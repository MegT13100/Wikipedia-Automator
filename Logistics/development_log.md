## Development Log (matatov-suminc2-mrtobin2-emilyc7)

### Week 11/15
* Submitted proposal for final approval.

### Week 11/22
* Researched implementations for data processing
* Researched BFS traversal and shortest path for our graph type
* Familiarized ourselves with our respective algorithms (PageRank or Force Directed Graph)

### Week 11/29
* Implemented reading in the data, graph processsing, and data storage, including writing and passing test cases
* Implemented BFS traversal and shortest path algorithm, including writing and passing test cases
* Midproject check in 12/3 3:45pm

### Week 12/6
* processed data to fit our computer's capabilities
* Completed force directed graph and visualization
* Began PageRank implementation and test cases

### Week 12/13
